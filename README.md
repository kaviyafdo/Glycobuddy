# Glycobuddy
A device for type 1 diabetic management, containing games and blood glucose level data. When your Glycobuddy is received, "glycobuddy.ino" and "icons.c" will be uploaded on it already, however, different code can be added to the Arduino Uno R3 by the individual if desired. Please open "Branches" and "Add-on-games" branch for additional games to upload onto the Glycobuddy.
