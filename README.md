# Glycobuddy
A device for type 1 diabetic management, containing games and blood glucose level data. When your Glycobuddy is received, "glycobuddy.ino" and "icons.c" will be uploaded on it already, however, different code can be added to the Arduino Uno R3 by the individual if desired. In order to add more games to the device, you must use a "USB 2.0 Cable Type A/B" and connect it to your laptop. Download Arduino IDE platform and all needed libraries. Then, open the github link, enter the "Branches" category, and download the games wanted from "Add-on-games". These games are saved as zip files, and make sure to open the files and move them into the arduino folder. This code can run one at a time. After transferring the files, make sure to verify and upload code. Then make sure to connect the GlycoBuddy battery to the battery snap to dc connector.
